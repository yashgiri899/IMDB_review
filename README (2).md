# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a **Neural Network model** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Text Preprocessing** (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction
- **Neural Network** model for binary classification (positive/negative reviews)
- **Model Evaluation** using accuracy and classification report

---

## üìÇ Dataset

The IMDB dataset used in this project contains **50,000 movie reviews** labeled as either positive or negative.

> **Note:** Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not uploaded in this repository. However, you can download it from the Kaggle link below:
>
> [üîó IMDB Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

After downloading, place the dataset (`IMDB Dataset.csv`) inside a `data/` folder at the root of this project.

## üö¶ How to Run

Make sure you have placed the dataset correctly, then simply run:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Train the model
- Evaluate performance on the test set
- Print out the classification report


---

## üìà Model Performance

The model is trained with EarlyStopping to avoid overfitting. Typical test accuracy is around **85-90%**, but it may vary slightly depending on training conditions.


---

## üìö Libraries Used

- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **nltk**
- **tensorflow / keras**
- **numpy**
